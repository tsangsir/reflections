Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A .git directory with git admin files were created, although no files 
where included in the repo yet.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: A staging area stands for the files to be included in next commit.
It allow you to hold some changes in the working directory so that it's not 
committed.
The repository contains committed changes pushed into the repository
